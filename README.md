# My Website
**[tj-martinez.com](https://tj-martinez.com/)**

This is the repo for my personal website, which contains my contact information, portfolio, resume, and bio. 

This repo is not where I keep the work that I show off in my portfolio. The repos for my programming work can be found under the indivdual page for each project in my [Portfolio](tj-martinez.com/mywork).
